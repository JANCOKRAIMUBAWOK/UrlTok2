# About the Project

I have made a few earlier versions of UrlTok thanks to the demand of updates, after a lot of debugging and writing new functions Urltok has finally become a stable mass-converter.
The program has six main features, with the most important one, the mass converter. 
Thanks to the [Tikmate](https://tikmate.app/) API, Urltok has been able to:
- Download videos without watermark.
- Download videos in the highest quality possible.
- Download easy, fast and free.

> Urltok is written in C# & .NETFramework Version 4.7.2

# Setup and Installation

The easiest way to start using UrlTok is by downloading the newest [Release](https://github.com/Sat178/UrlTok2/releases) version, another way for more experienced users, I recommend to fork the repository so u can make the changes and build after.

After installing easily run the .exe and start using the program. To configurate your own personal preference make sure to edit the .JSON file correctly has shown below:

```json
{
	"directory_create": "true", // true, false
	"show_stats": "true", // true, false
	"save_raw": "true", // true, false
	"proxies": "All" // Https, Socks4, Socks5, All
}
```

# How to use UrlTok

Option 1:
- Simply check the current config values, if you want to change it make sure to edit the file 'ttConfig.json'.
- *For all new user I'd recommend to check option 1 first to configurate all your preferences!*

Option 2:
- Scrape 3 sorts of proxies, Http/s, Socks4, Socks5 from public API's.
- *Usage of proxies is not yet implemented but will be in the future!*

Option 3:
- Download a TikTok video manually by just inserting the video url.

Option 4:
- Load in your file with Tiktok urls, and Urltok does the magic. Mass convert all videos with a single click.
- - Make sure Tiktok urls are divided by a newline!
- *Let it run in the background with Low CPU usage!*

Option 5 + 6:
- A function to check the Github repository and the Discord Support servers.
